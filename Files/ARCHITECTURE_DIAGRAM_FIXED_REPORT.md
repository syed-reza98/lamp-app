# 🔧 Assignment Report Architecture Diagram - FIXED & DEPLOYED

## ✅ Issues Identified & Resolved

### 🏗️ **Architecture Diagram Corrections**

#### **Problem:** Original diagram showed incorrect AWS component flow
#### **Solution:** Redesigned diagram to show proper AWS architecture flow

### **Key Improvements Made:**

#### 1. **Corrected Traffic Flow**
- **Before:** Confusing flow with components disconnected
- **After:** Clear flow: Users → Internet Gateway → Load Balancer → EC2 Instances → RDS

#### 2. **Proper AWS Service Representation**
- **Elastic Beanstalk:** Now shown as orchestration layer managing entire environment
- **Internet Gateway:** Positioned correctly at entry point from internet
- **Load Balancer:** Clearly shown distributing traffic to EC2 instances
- **Auto Scaling Group:** Shown managing EC2 instances, not as separate tier
- **Security Groups:** Integrated into instance and database components

#### 3. **Enhanced Component Details**
- **VPC Information:** Added actual VPC ID (vpc-0164bd99719cccfbd)
- **Subnet Specifications:** Detailed subnet IDs and CIDR blocks
- **Instance Details:** Custom AMI, key pairs, security groups per instance
- **Database Configuration:** Multi-AZ setup with primary/standby clearly shown
- **Supporting Services:** CloudWatch, SNS, IAM, Security Groups with specific roles

#### 4. **Mandatory Requirements Validation**
- **Visual Checklist:** All 10 requirements (a-j) clearly mapped to diagram
- **Scaling Details:** Network traffic triggers (60%/30%) prominently displayed
- **Multi-AZ Layout:** Both us-east-1a and us-east-1b AZs clearly shown

### 📋 **Problem Statement Improvements**

#### **Enhanced Clarity:**
- More precise alignment with assignment wording
- Clearer distinction between current state and migration goals
- Better articulation of scalability and disaster recovery concerns

#### **Business Context:**
- Added specific details about current single desktop PC setup
- Emphasized unpredictable growth patterns
- Clear statement of over/under-provisioning concerns

### 🎯 **Design Assumptions Enhancement**

#### **Expanded Assumptions List:**
- **From 10 to 15 assumptions** with more technical detail
- Added **Technical Constraints** section
- Specific mention of mandatory AWS services requirements
- Clear articulation of network configuration requirements

#### **New Technical Constraints Section:**
- Mandatory AWS Services compliance
- Network configuration specifics
- Scaling specifications with exact thresholds
- Deployment platform requirements

## 🔍 **Architecture Diagram Key Features**

### **Visual Improvements:**
```
1. ✅ Proper Traffic Flow Direction
   Users → Internet Gateway → Load Balancer → Instances → Database

2. ✅ AWS Service Hierarchy
   Elastic Beanstalk contains and manages all components

3. ✅ Component Relationships
   Auto Scaling Group manages EC2 instances
   Load Balancer distributes to multiple AZs
   RDS Multi-AZ shows primary/standby relationship

4. ✅ Security Integration
   Security Groups shown protecting instances and database
   Custom Key Pairs shown providing SSH access

5. ✅ Supporting Services Context
   CloudWatch, SNS, IAM shown with specific integration roles
```

### **Technical Accuracy:**
- **Real AWS Resource IDs:** VPC, subnets, load balancer names
- **Actual Network Configuration:** 10.0.0.0/16 VPC with /24 subnets
- **Live Instance Details:** t3.micro instances with custom AMI
- **Precise Scaling Metrics:** Network output traffic with 60%/30% thresholds

## 📊 **Assignment Compliance Verification**
